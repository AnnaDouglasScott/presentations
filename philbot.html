    What problem were we trying to solve?
  </h2>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>
      Our production editor needed somewhere to store large media files. He was putting things into Google Drive out of neccessity, but this was was far from ideal

      Our production editor is called Phil

    But for Rackspace Cloudfiles

  <aside class='notes'>
    After a bit of back-and-forth between Phil and the tech team, it seemed like we needed something like the Amazon S3 Appliance, but for Rackspace

  <aside class='notes'>
    Gus pointed us towards this blogpost. It contained some ugly bash - any sufficiently useful bash script is ugly - designed to run on Redhat something, and we're more of an Ubuntu shop. It also relies on some Python thing, and we're Rubyists. But this was a good start

    Ran this up on a VirtualBox VM

  <h3>
    It was clunky, but it worked

  <aside class='notes'>
    I kicked this around and got it working just enough on Ubuntu using the Fog Rubygem, which gave me confidence that it could be done

    Underneath, we use Samba for file-sharing, and Redis to provide a queue

    Turns out it's hard to test asynchronous things. But we were able to put this into continuous integration on Travis

    The hardware

    That's a Raspberry Pi and a 2 TB external drive, and the whole thing cost about Â£100

    Avahi means it auto-advertises itself on the network - you just enter your credentials and you're set. Drag files on and they are asynchronously uploaded to Cloudfiles, update them and they are updated, delete them and they are deleted

    Roadmap
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Auto-configuration
    </li>
    <li>
      Cold storage
    </li>
    <li>
      Raspberry Pi image
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class='notes'>
    Auto-configuration, where an out-of-the-box install will offer up a dummy configuration, which can be filled in, Philbot will notice the file has changed and move it into the correct location, and it will all just work.
